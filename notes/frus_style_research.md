# FRUS Annotation Research Attempt

I attempted to retrieve the published FRUS volume located at
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HistoryAtState/frus/master/volumes/frus1981-88v05.xml`
to study the annotation style and rules. Network access to raw GitHub content is
restricted in the current execution environment, and each download attempt failed with
`CONNECT tunnel failed, response 403`. Because of this limitation, I was unable to review
the requested volume or summarize the FRUS annotation conventions it contains.

If external network access becomes available, rerun the `curl` command above (or clone
the `HistoryAtState/frus` repository) to obtain the XML volume for analysis.
